Competitive Coding Practice

***1. A-WaterMelon***

Input

The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output

Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.


***2. A-Wrong Subtraction***

Input

The first line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (2≤n≤109, 1≤k≤50) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.

Output

Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing n by one k times.


***3. WayTooLongWords***

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

Output

Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.


***4. BearAndBigBrother***

Input

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.

Output

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.



***5. Tram***

Input

The first line contains a single number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of the tram's stops.

Then n lines follow, each contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 1000) — the number of passengers that exits the tram at the i-th stop, and the number of passengers that enter the tram at the i-th stop. The stops are given from the first to the last stop in the order of tram's movement.

The number of people who exit at a given stop does not exceed the total number of people in the tram immediately before it arrives at the stop. More formally, . This particularly means that a1 = 0.
At the last stop, all the passengers exit the tram and it becomes empty. More formally, .
No passenger will enter the train at the last stop. That is, bn = 0.

Output

Print a single integer denoting the minimum possible capacity of the tram (0 is allowed).


***6. Stones on the Table***

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of stones on the table.

The next line contains string s, which represents the colors of the stones. We'll consider the stones in the row numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Then the i-th character s equals "R", if the i-th stone is red, "G", if it's green and "B", if it's blue.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.


***7. Word Capitalization***

Input

A single line contains a non-empty word. This word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters. The length of the word will not exceed 103.

Output

Output the given word after capitalization.


***8. Helpful Maths***

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most 100 characters long.  ***input: 3+2+1***

Output

Print the new sum that Xenia can count. ***output: 1+2+3***
